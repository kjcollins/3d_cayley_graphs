# 3d_cayley_graphs
Visualization tool for 3D Cayley graphs 

(Work supported in part by an IMA Coding Sprint)

## Optional/experimental SageMath package
Package based on visualization tool at reflections.swarthmore.edu.

We are refactoring the code running the website into a package for use in SageMath.

## Dependencies and Instructions

This code depends on a SageMath installation, with optional package gap3 running. 
Instructions for how to test the file included in 'testing.txt'. 
'cayley_model.py' contains the ReflectionGroup3d class, created as a Graphics object in 
SageMath, which plots Sage ReflectionGroups as rigid objects in 3d space.
