Note to collaborators:

To run tests, copy following line:

sage -t --long --optional=gap3,mpir,python2,sage --verbose cayley_model.py

-t specifies to run file's tests
--long runs any test flagged as long,
and --optional runs tests flagged as using gap3.
--verbose provides extra debugging output.

However, currently plot3d tests are breaking, and also possibly no
other tests are running at all.
